Improve `flatiter` indexing by using ndarray index preparation
--------------------------------------------------------------

The `flatiter`` object now shares the same index preparation logic as
`ndarray`, ensuring consistent behavior and fixing several issues where
invalid indices were previously accepted or misinterpreted.

Key fixes and improvements:

* Stricter index validation

  Complicated non-array indices like ``arr.flat[[True, True]]`` and
  ``arr.flat[[1.0, 1.0]]`` were incorrectly
  treated as ``arr.flat[[1, 1]]``. They now raise an `IndexError`. Array
  indices should be used instead.

* Consistent error types:

  Certain invalid `flatiter` indices that previously raised `ValueError`
  now correctly raise `IndexError`, aligning with `ndarray` behavior.

* Improved error messages:

  The error message for unsupported index operations now provides more
  specific details, including explicitly listing the valid index types,
  instead of the generic ``IndexError: unsupported index operation``.
